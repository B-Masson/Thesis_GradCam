# Gradient Activation branch, developed and written by Richard Masson
Seconary repo for master's thesis. Contains all the code used to generate gradient activation maps. Also contains backup copies of the model generation code found in the primary repo.

Created in collaboration with the University of Cape Town, South Africa. All code here exists purely for academic purposes, and is not intended for actual use outside of the dissertation.
